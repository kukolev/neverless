Main workflow is here:

    User            ->  sends dto of command to RestController
    RestController  ->  sends dto of command to CommandService
    CommandService  ->  converts dto of command to Command
    CommandService  ->  executes method execute() of Command
    Command         ->  process method onExecute(), generates events
    CommandService  ->  call process() method in AiService
    RestController  ->  call render() method in RenderService
    RestController  ->  sends data to User
